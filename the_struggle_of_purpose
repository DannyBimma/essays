The Struggle of Purpose

Look, mum!! I can suffer anxiety with no hands!! I
mean, I'm exceptionally adept at nervously breaking
down whenever I think about my future. I hate always
feeling as if I already know exactly where I'm gonna
be in five years... which is in the exact same position
I find myself in now.

A wise man will tell you to never compare yourself to
others. Unfortunately, I identify as an ignorant, teenage,
robot girl; so I often have a look at what my peers and
old friends from school are doing with their lives. And
boy are they doing! Most of them have started their own
families, have multiple children, are steadfast moving up
the corporate ladder, and otherwise crushing it with their
own entrepreneurial endeavours. Meanwhile; I'm out here 
failing miserably at Computer Science, and talking to anyone 
on the internet who will listen me gush about a fictional 
latex pirate.
