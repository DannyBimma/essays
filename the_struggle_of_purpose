The Struggle of Purpose

Look, mum!! I can suffer anxiety with no hands!! I
mean, I'm exceptionally adept at nervously breaking
down whenever I think about my future. I hate always
feeling as if I already know exactly where I'm gonna
be in five years... which is in the exact same position
I find myself in now.
