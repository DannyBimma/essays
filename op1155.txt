One Piece Chapter 1155 Review - DannyBimma

Right off the bat, the chapter answered one of the biggest questions 
I had about Loki--what could he have seen in Rock's to idolise him 
the way he did. But it made perfect sense once it was revealed that 
Rock's and his primordial crew were the first humans Loki ever met.

Not only was Rock's the first human he ever saw in the flesh, but he 
was the first person who ever rivalled him in strength, and the first 
man he ever saw oppose his father's Kingly position.

And speaking of Rock's, this was definitely his chapter; and I wouldn't 
be at all upset if it turned into his flashback entirely. This man commands 
something that goes way beyond aura. Roger, Shank's, Luffy, even fucking 
Imu themselves somehow look like chumps when held up against Xe Beck.
