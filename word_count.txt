The Famous WC Program

Once I learn the basics of a new programming language and I print 
"Hello, world!" to the screen for the first time. The first
"real program" I try to build after that is Word Count (wc). Simply
because it's one of those things I happen to enjoy building from
scratch and from memory. And since I'm a writer of prose, it's
something I happen to use every single day as well.
