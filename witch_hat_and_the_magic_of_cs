Witch Hat and the Magic of Computer Science

About a week ago, I picked up the Tongari Boushi no Atelier
(とんがり帽子のアトリエ) manga series. And right off the bat
more than a few aspects greatly impressed me about this
serialisation.

The stupendously stupefying and intricately detailed
illustrations; the masterful manipulation of the panels on
page, the deft placement and potent usage of negative pace,
and an extremely compelling fantasy epic to weave it all
through. These are all the elements that made me fall in love
with Witch Hat Atelier within it's initial few pages. But what 
impressed me most of all, is the beautifully uncanny way it's
power system fits the world of Computer Science.

The most ostensible place this similarity is depicted is in the 
detailed inner workings of the power system itself.

Runes; can be interpreted as main, the entry point to a program,
the code that roughly defines what an app shall do when it's run.

Keystones, would be the variables a program uses during it's
execution. The data within them can obviously vary in type,
amount, length, and shape. These manipulations in the variables
then go on to dictate exactly how a process will behave.
