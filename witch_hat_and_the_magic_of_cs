Witch Hat and the Magic of Computer Science

About a week ago, I picked up the Tongari Boushi no Atelier
(とんがり帽子のアトリエ) manga series. And right off the bat
more than a few aspects greatly impressed me about this
serialisation.

The stupendously stupefying and intricately detailed
illustrations; the masterful manipulation of the panels on
page, the deft placement and potent usage of negative pace,
and an extremely compelling fantasy epic to weave it all
through. These are all the elements that made me fall in love
with Witch Hat Atelier within it's initial few pages. But what 
impressed me most of all, is the beautifully uncanny way it's
power system fits the world of Computer Science.
